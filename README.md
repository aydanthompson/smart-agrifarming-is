To run model.ipynb, all CSVs from the IMU dataset must be present in the data directory, e.g., data/1_Walking_1319_20240513_120009.csv.

The IMU dataset, sourced from the paper "[A dataset for detecting walking, grazing, and resting behaviors in free-grazing cattle using IoT collar IMU signals](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2025.1630083/full)", can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/WASP-lab/db-cow-walking).
