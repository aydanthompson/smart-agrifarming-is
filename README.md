# Smart Agrifarming - Cattle Activity Analysis

Developed as part of the final assignment for the Information Systems (IS) module at the University of Suffolk.

## Diagrams

Diagrams for the complete data pipeline, architecture components, and cattle activity implementation can be found in [docs/architecture-diagrams.md](docs/architecture-diagrams.md).

## Data Sources

To run [model.ipynb](model.ipynb), all CSVs from the IMU dataset must be present in the data directory, e.g., data/1_Walking_1319_20240513_120009.csv.

The IMU dataset, sourced from the paper "[A dataset for detecting walking, grazing, and resting behaviors in free-grazing cattle using IoT collar IMU signals](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2025.1630083/full)", can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/WASP-lab/db-cow-walking).
